- Tiled ground not pickable for some reason?
- Generic React superclass that wraps an EventEmitter, for ease of wrapping Collabs state?
- Replace PeerJS server with own. For now, since not using Heroku anyway, just have it run on a different port.
- Move toolbox effects into CanvasWrapper.
- randomize player starting positions/rotations (discussion circle?)
- non-bear view of own volume level? For 1st person mode.
- Also: "Audio connecting..." indicator, for until PeerJS has connected. Failure indicator if it fails.
- Try reconnecting to PeerJS server if it fails to connect at first or gets disconnected? By default, it appears to give up forever, sometimes without even printing a failed-to-connect error.
- remember name, color, position
- focus on canvas after clicking toolbox
- In theory, WebSocketServer should be doing own keepalive, but doesn't seem to be preventing Heroku close. See https://github.com/theturtle32/WebSocket-Node/blob/master/lib/WebSocketConnection.js
For now, added manual ping every 30 sec; check this works.
WebSocket: use browser built-in instead of ws package, in client? ws package seems just for node.
